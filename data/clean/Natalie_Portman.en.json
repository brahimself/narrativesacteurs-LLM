    "Early life": "Natalie Hershlag<!--See discussion at Talk:Natalie Portman/Archive 5#\"Neta-Lee Hershlag\"--> was born on June 9, 1981, <!-- Please do not add a country next to her place of birth. This has been discussed and rejected at Talk:Natalie Portman/Jerusalem and Israel. Please read the talk page and archives. -->in Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, at Hadassah Medical Center to Jewish parents. She is the only child of Shelley Stevens, an Ohio-born artist, and Avner Hershlag, an Israeli-born gynecologist. Portman is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States.\n\nPortman and her family migrated to the United States when she was 3, first living in Washington, D.C., but relocating to Connecticut in 1988 and then settling in Syosset, Long Island. While living in Washington, Portman attended Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland. Her native language is Hebrew. While living on Long Island, she attended a Jewish elementary school, the Solomon Schechter Day School of Nassau County.\n\nWhen Portman was ten years old, a Revlon agent spotted her at a pizza restaurant and asked her to become a child model. She turned down the offer but used the opportunity to get an acting agent. She auditioned for the 1992 off-Broadway ''Ruthless!'', a musical about a girl who is prepared to commit murder to get the lead in a school play. Portman and Britney Spears were chosen as understudies for star Laura Bell Bundy. She played Mathilda, an orphan child who befriends a middle-aged hitman (played by Jean Reno). Her parents were reluctant to let her do the part due to the explicit sexual and violent nature of the script, but agreed after Besson took out the Mathilda character's nudity and killings that she committed. Portman herself said that after those scenes were removed, she found nothing objectionable about the content. Even so, her mother was displeased with some of the \"sexual twists and turns\" in the finished film, which were not part of the script.\n\nPortman on playing sexualized youngsters as a child, 2007 Impressed by her performance in ''The Professional'', the director Ted Demme cast her as a precocious teenager who flirts with her much-older neighbor (played by Timothy Hutton) in the ensemble comedy-drama ''Beautiful Girls'' (1996). She subsequently went back to Stagedoor Manor to appear in a production of the musical ''Cabaret''. Also in 1996, Portman had brief roles in Woody Allen's musical ''Everyone Says I Love You'' and Tim Burton's comic science fiction film ''Mars Attacks!''\n\nPortman was cast opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann's ''Romeo + Juliet'' (1996), but she dropped out during rehearsals when studio executives found her too young for the role. She was also offered Adrian Lyne's ''Lolita'', based on the novel of the same name, but she turned down the part due to its excessive sexual content.\n\nPortman instead signed on to star as Anne Frank in a Broadway revival of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'', which was staged at the Music Box Theatre from December 1997 to May 1998. In preparation, she twice visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and interacted with Miep Gies, who had preserved Anne's diary after the family was captured; she found a connection with Frank's story, given her own family's history with the Holocaust. Reviewing the production for ''Variety'', Greg Evans disliked her portrayal, which he thought had \"little of the charm, budding genius or even brittle intelligence that the diary itself reveals\". Conversely, Ben Brantley found an \"ineffable grace in her awkwardness\". The experience of performing the play was emotionally draining for her, as she attended high school during the day and performed at night; she wrote personal essays in ''Time'' and ''Seventeen'' magazines about her experience.",
    "2007–2015: Career expansion and ''Black Swan''": "thumb|left|upright|alt=Portman in 2008|Portman at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member]]\n\nPortman began 2007 by replacing Jodie Foster in Wong Kar-wai's romantic drama ''My Blueberry Nights'', which was his first English-language film. For her role as a gambler, she trained with a poker coach. Richard Corliss of ''Time'' magazine believed that \"for once she's not playing a waif or a child princess but a mature, full-bodied woman\" and commended her \"vibrancy, grittiness and ache, all performed with a virtuosa's easy assurance\". Her next appearance was in ''Hotel Chevalier'', a short film from Wes Anderson, which served as a prolog to his feature ''The Darjeeling Limited'' (in which Portman had a cameo). In the short, she and Jason Schwartzman play former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room. For the first time, Portman performed an extended nude scene; she was later disappointed at the undue focus on it and she subsequently swore off appearing nude again. Keen to work in different genres, Portman accepted a role in the children's film ''Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium'', playing an employee of a magical toy store. She also appeared in Paul McCartney's music video \"Dance Tonight\" from his album ''Memory Almost Full'', directed by Michel Gondry.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Portman portrayed rival sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn, respectively, in the period film ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' (2008). She was excited by the opportunity to work opposite another actress her age, bemoaning that such casting was rare in film. Derek Elley of ''Variety'' was critical of Portman's English accent and wrote that she \"doesn't quite bring the necessary heft to make Anne a truly dominant power player\". The film had modest box-office earnings. She served as a jury member of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and also launched her own production company, named handsomecharlie films, after her late dog. Portman's directorial debut, the short film ''Eve'', opened the short-film screenings at the 65th Venice International Film Festival. It is about a young woman who goes to her grandmother's romantic date, and Portman drew inspiration for the older character (played by Lauren Bacall) from her own grandmother.\n\nA poorly received adaptation of Ayelet Waldman's novel ''Love and Other Impossible Pursuits'', entitled ''The Other Woman'', marked Portman's first film role of 2009. She appeared in a faux perfume commercial called ''Greed'', directed by Roman Polanski, and in the anthology film ''New York, I Love You'', she directed a segment and also starred in a different segment directed by Mira Nair. Portman next took on a role opposite Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal in the drama film ''Brothers'', a remake of the 2004 Danish film of the same name. Her role was that of a war widow, for which she spoke with military wives to prepare. The film was shot during the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, and Portman found it challenging to shoot certain scenes without a written script. Claudia Puig of ''USA Today'' found her to be \"subdued and reactive in a part that doesn't call for her to do much else\".\n\nAfter producing and co-starring alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the black comedy ''Hesher'' (2010), Portman played a ballerina overwhelmed with the prospect of performing ''Swan Lake'' in Darren Aronofsky's psychological horror film ''Black Swan''. She was trained by the professional ballerina Mary Helen Bowers, and in preparation, she trained for five to eight hours daily for six months and lost . Her performance was acclaimed; writing for ''Empire'', Dan Jolin found her to be \"simultaneously at her most vulnerable and her most predatory, at once frostily brittle and raunchily malleable [...] before peaking at the film's denouement with a raw, alluring showstopper of a performance.\" ''Black Swan'' emerged as a sleeper hit, grossing over $329&nbsp;million worldwide against a $13&nbsp;million budget, and earned Portman several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress. Following her Oscar win, controversy arose over who performed the bulk of the on-screen dancing in the film. Sarah Lane, one of Portman's dancing doubles in the film, claimed that the actress performed only about five percent of the full-body shots, adding that she was asked by the film's producers not to speak publicly about it during awards season. Aronofsky defended Portman by insisting that she had performed 80 percent of the on-screen dancing. It received unfavorable reviews but was a commercial success. She next agreed to the film ''Your Highness'' for the opportunity of playing an athletic and foul-mouthed character, which she believed was rare for actresses. Critics were dismissive of the film's reliance on scatological humor and it proved to be a box-office bomb. In her final film release of 2011, Portman took on the part of Jane Foster, a scientist and love-interest of the titular character (played by Chris Hemsworth) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film ''Thor''. She liked the idea of Kenneth Branagh directing a big-budget film that emphasized character; she signed on to it before receiving a script, and helped develop her part by reading the biography of scientists such as Rosalind Franklin. Richard Kuipers of ''Variety'' commended Portman's \"sterling work in a thinly written role\" for adding dimension to the film's romantic subplot. ''Thor'' earned $449.3&nbsp;million worldwide to emerge as the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Portman topped ''Forbes'' listing of the most bankable stars in Hollywood. Her sole screen appearance that year was in Paul McCartney's music video \"My Valentine\", alongside Johnny Depp. The following year, she reprised the role of Jane Foster in ''Thor: The Dark World'', which earned over $644&nbsp;million worldwide to emerge as the 10th highest-grossing film of 2013. ''Forbes'' featured her in their Celebrity 100 listing of 2014, and estimated her income from the previous year to be $13&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2015, Portman appeared alongside an ensemble cast, including Christian Bale, in Terrence Malick's experimental drama film ''Knight of Cups'', which marked her first project after giving birth. She shot for it within a week of returning to work and she did not receive a traditional script or dialogues, improvising most of her scenes with Bale. She said that shooting with Malick influenced her own directorial venture, ''A Tale of Love and Darkness'' which was released in the same year. She had wanted to adapt the book since she first read it a decade ago, but postponed it until she was old enough to play the leading role of a mother herself. She collaborated closely with Amos, showing him drafts of her script as she adapted the book. While the film received partial funding from the rightist Israeli government, Portman said the film was \"absolutely not\" pro-Israeli or patriotic. The film also touches on the dispossession of Palestinians resulting from the 1948 war during Israel's founding phase. She later remarked that it was easier to be a female director in Israel than in the U.S., \"thanks to the IDF\". She explained that Israeli men are accustomed to female officers and commanders, \"making it easier for them to accept female authority.\" Critics gave the film generally positive reviews. A. O. Scott of ''The New York Times'' found it to be a \"conscientious adaptation of a difficult book\" and was appreciative of Portman's potential as a filmmaker.\n\nShe next produced and starred in the western film ''Jane Got a Gun'' about a young mother seeking vengeance. Initially scheduled to be directed by Lynne Ramsay, the production was plagued with numerous difficulties. Ramsay did not turn up on set for the first day of filming and was eventually replaced with Gavin O'Connor. Michael Fassbender, Jude Law, and Bradley Cooper were all cast as the male lead, before Ewan McGregor played the part. Peter Bradshaw of ''The Guardian'' reviewed that Portman's \"stately performance\" was not enough to save the \"laborious and solemn western\", and it grossed less than $4&nbsp;million against its $25&nbsp;million budget.",
    "Personal life": "upright|thumb|Portman with [[Benjamin Millepied in 2012]]\nPortman speaks English, Hebrew, French, German, Japanese and Arabic, to various degrees. In 2005, she bought an apartment in Richard Meier's glass tower in the West Village for $5.7 million. In 2008, she listed it for sale at $6.55 million. In 2006, Portman expressed a strong connection to her Jewish identity, particularly in Israel, and shared her desire to raise her children Jewish: \"A priority for me is definitely that I'd like to raise my kids Jewish, but the ultimate thing is to have someone who is a good person and who is a partner.\" \n\nPortman has discreetly dated Zach Braff, Jake Gyllenhaal, The couple met in 2009 while working together on ''Black Swan'', and wed on August 4, 2012, in a Jewish ceremony in Big Sur, California.\n\nIn 2013, she was living in Los Angeles. After Millepied was appointed director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet, the family relocated to Paris in the autumn of 2014, where Portman also expressed interest in obtaining French citizenship. In January 2014, Millepied announced that he was in the process of converting to Judaism. From 2017 to 2021, Portman owned a home in Montecito. She still owns a home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. In early 2023, reports surfaced alleging an extramarital affair by Millepied. The couple never publicly addressed the claims. On March 8, 2024, it was announced that Portman and Millepied had divorced."
