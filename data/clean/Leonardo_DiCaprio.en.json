    "Early life and acting background": "Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California. He is the only child of Irmelin Indenbirken, a German legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an American underground comix artist and distributor. The couple met while attending college and moved to Los Angeles after graduating. George's paternal grandparents, Salvatore Di Caprio and Rosina Cassella, were Italian, while his mother, Olga Anne Jacobs, was of German descent. Irmelin's father, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German, while her mother, Helene Indenbirken, was a Russian immigrant living in Germany. Some sources have falsely claimed that Helene was born in Odesa, Ukraine; there is no evidence that DiCaprio has any relatives of Ukrainian birth or heritage.\n\nDiCaprio got his name because a pregnant Irmelin first felt him kick while she was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy. When he was one year old, Irmelin and George divorced after the latter fell in love with another woman and moved out. To raise DiCaprio together, Irmelin and George moved into twin cottages with a shared garden in Echo Park, Los Angeles. George lived with his girlfriend and her son, Adam Farrar, with whom DiCaprio developed a close bond. DiCaprio and Irmelin later moved to other neighborhoods, such as Los Feliz. He has described Irmelin and George as \"bohemian in every sense of the word\" and as \"the people I trust the most in the world\". DiCaprio has mentioned growing up poor in a neighborhood plagued with prostitution, crime and violence. Attending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years and later Seeds Elementary School, DiCaprio later enrolled at John Marshall High School. He disliked public school and wanted to audition for acting jobs instead. He dropped out of high school later, eventually earning a general equivalency diploma.\n\nAs a child, DiCaprio wanted to become either a marine biologist or an actor. He eventually favored the latter; he liked impersonating characters and imitating people, and enjoyed seeing their reactions to his acting. According to DiCaprio, his interest in performing began at the age of two when he went onto the stage at a performance festival and danced spontaneously to a positive response from the crowd. He was also motivated to learn acting when Farrar's appearance in a television commercial earned him $50,000. DiCaprio has said in interviews that his first television appearance was in the children's series ''Romper Room'', and that he was dismissed from the show for being disruptive. The show's host has denied that any children were removed from the show in this way. At age 11, DiCaprio almost quit acting to pursue breakdancing, having gotten second place in a competition in Irmelin's native Germany. At age 14, he began appearing in several commercials for Matchbox cars, which he calls his first role. In 1989, he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show ''The New Lassie''.\n\nAt the beginning of his career, DiCaprio had difficulty finding an agent. When he found one, the agent suggested that DiCaprio change his name to Lenny Williams to appeal to American audiences, which he declined to do. DiCaprio remained jobless for a year and a half, although he had 100auditions. Following this lack of success, DiCaprio was going to give up acting but George persuaded him to persevere. Motivated by George and by the prospect of financial security, DiCaprio continued to audition. After a talent agent, who knew Irmelin's friend, recommended him to casting directors, DiCaprio secured roles in about 20commercials.\n\nBy the early1990s, DiCaprio began acting regularly on television, starting with a role in the pilot of ''The Outsiders'' (1990) and one episode of the soap opera ''Santa Barbara'' (1990), in which he played a teenage alcoholic. DiCaprio's career prospects improved when he was cast in ''Parenthood'', a series based on the 1989 comedy film. To prepare for the role of Garry Buckman, a troubled teenager, he analyzed Joaquin Phoenix's performance in the original film. His work that year earned two nominations at the 12th Youth in Film Awards—Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series for ''Santa Barbara'' and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series for ''Parenthood''. Around this time, he was a contestant on the children's game show ''Fun House'', on which he performed several stunts, including catching the fish inside a small pool using only his teeth."
