    "Early life and background": "Angelina Jolie Voight was born on June 4, 1975, at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California, to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer Chip Taylor and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight. Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell. On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent, while on her mother's side, she is of Dutch and French ancestry. She is a distant relative of former Dutch Finance Minister and Prime Minister Wim Kok. Jolie has claimed to have distant Indigenous (Iroquois) ancestry through her French-Canadian mother. However, her father says Jolie is \"not seriously Iroquois\", saying it is something he and Bertrand made up to make Bertrand seem more \"exotic\".\n\nthumb|left|upright|Jolie's father, actor [[Jon Voight, attending the 60th Academy Awards in 1988]]\n\nFollowing her parents' separation in 1976, she and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Jolie's mother raised her as a Catholic but did not require her to go to church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though she had a bit part in Voight's ''Lookin' to Get Out'' (1982) at age seven. they returned to Los Angeles five years later.\n\nJolie first attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt isolated among the children of some of the area's affluent families because her mother had a more modest income. She was teased by other students, who targeted her for being extremely thin and for wearing glasses and braces. She transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a \"punk outsider\", taking at-home courses on embalming. At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment before returning to theater studies,\n\nAs a teenager, Jolie found it difficult to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed, later commenting, \"For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me.\" She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder Jolie had episodes of depression and planned to commit suicide twice—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her.\n\nJolie has had a lifelong dysfunctional relationship with her father, which started when Voight left the family when she was less than a year old. She has said that from then on their time together was sporadic and usually carried out in front of the press. They reconciled when they appeared together in ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001), but their relationship again deteriorated. Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on ''Access Hollywood'', in which he claimed Jolie had \"serious mental problems.\" At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with him. Jolie and Voight did not speak for six-and-a-half years, eventually rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, and they both went public with their reconciliation three years later. Jolie then learned from her father by noticing his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship was less strained during this time, with Jolie realizing that they were both \"drama queens\". ''Hackers'' failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release. The role in ''Hackers'' is considered Jolie's breakthrough.\n\nAfter starring in the modern-day ''Romeo and Juliet'' adaptation ''Love Is All There Is'' (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie ''Mojave Moon'' (1996). In ''Foxfire'' (1996) she played Legs, a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote of her performance, \"It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst.\"\n\nIn 1997, Jolie starred with David Duchovny in the thriller ''Playing God'', set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; ''Chicago Sun-Times'' critic Roger Ebert wrote that Jolie \"finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is.\" Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the CBS miniseries ''True Women'' (1997), was even less successful; writing for ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', Robert Strauss dismissed her as \"horrid, a fourth-rate Scarlett O'Hara\" who relies on \"gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips.\" Jolie also starred in the music video for the Rolling Stones's \"Anybody Seen My Baby?\" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City."
