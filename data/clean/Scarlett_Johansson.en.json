    "Early life": "thumb|upright|The [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, where Johansson learned to act as a child|alt=A red-brick three-story building with a tree outside it.]]\n\nScarlett Ingrid Johansson was born on November 22, 1984, in the Manhattan borough of New York City. Johansson's father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark. Through him, she is a granddaughter of Ejner Johansson, an art historian, screenwriter and film director, whose own father was Swedish. She has an older sister named Vanessa, who is also an actress, an older brother named Adrian, and a twin brother named Hunter. Johansson also has an older half-brother named Christian from her father's first marriage. She holds dual American and Danish citizenship. On a 2017 episode of PBS's ''Finding Your Roots'', she discovered that her maternal great-grandfather's brother and extended family died in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust.\n\nJohansson attended PS 41, an elementary school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Her parents divorced when she was thirteen. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, Johansson often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands. Johansson took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. She has described her childhood as very ordinary.\n\nAs a child, Johansson practiced acting by staring in the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be like Judy Garland in ''Meet Me in St. Louis''. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her brothers instead of her, but later decided to become an actress anyway. After enrolling at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and auditioning for commercials, Johansson soon lost interest, stating \"I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread.\" She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance with two lines in the off-Broadway play ''Sophistry'' with Ethan Hawke. Later that year, she made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy ''North'' (1994). Johansson's first leading role was as Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her foster home in ''Manny & Lo'' (1996) alongside Aleksa Palladino and her brother, Hunter. Her performance received positive reviews: one written for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' noted, \"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of&nbsp;... Scarlett Johansson,\" while critic Mick LaSalle, writing for the same paper, commented on her \"peaceful aura\", and believed, \"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\" Johansson earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for the role.\n\nAfter appearing in minor roles in ''Fall'' and ''Home Alone 3'' (both in 1997), Johansson attracted wider attention for her performance in the film ''The Horse Whisperer'' (1998), co-starring director Robert Redford. Todd McCarthy of ''Variety'' commented that Johansson \"convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance\". For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress. She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they \"portray kids like mall rats and not seriously&nbsp;... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth.\"\n\nJohansson later appeared in ''My Brother the Pig'' (1999) and in the Coen brothers' neo-noir film ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' (2001). Her breakthrough came playing a cynical outcast in Terry Zwigoff's black comedy ''Ghost World'' (2001), an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel of the same name. Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be a \"unique, eccentric person, and right for that part\". The film premiered at the 2001 Seattle International Film Festival; although a box office failure, it has since developed a cult status. Johansson was credited with \"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\" by an ''Austin Chronicle'' critic and won a Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. With David Arquette, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy ''Eight Legged Freaks'' (2002) about a collection of spiders exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow gigantic and begin killing animals and people. After graduating from Professional Children's School that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but was rejected, and decided to focus on her film career.",
    "Music career": "thumb|upright|Johansson attending the premiere of ''[[Sing (2016 American film)|Sing'' at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival]]\n\nIn 2006, Johansson sang the track \"Summertime\" for ''Unexpected Dreams – Songs from the Stars'', a non-profit collection of songs recorded by Hollywood actors. She performed with the Jesus and Mary Chain for a Coachella reunion show in Indio, California, in April 2007. The following year, Johansson appeared as the leading lady in Justin Timberlake's music video, for \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\", which was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.\n\nIn May 2008, Johansson released her debut album ''Anywhere I Lay My Head'', which consists of one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. ''Spin'' was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics found it to be \"surprisingly alluring\", \"a bravely eccentric selection\", and \"a brilliant album\" with \"ghostly magic\". ''NME'' named the album the \"23rd best album of 2008\", and it peaked at number126 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Johansson started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old, and said of him, \"His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I had my own way of doing Tom Waits songs.\"\n\nIn September 2009, Johansson and singer-songwriter Pete Yorn released a collaborative album, ''Break Up'', inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's duets with Brigitte Bardot. The album reached number 41 in the US. In 2010, Steel Train released ''Terrible Thrills Vol.1'', which includes their favorite female artists singing songs from their self-titled album. Johansson is the first artist on the album, singing \"Bullet\". Johansson sang \"One Whole Hour\" for the 2011 soundtrack of the documentary film ''Wretches & Jabberers'' (2010). In 2012 sang on a J.Ralph track entitled \"Before My Time\" for the end credits of the climate documentary ''Chasing Ice'' (2012), which received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nIn February 2015, Johansson formed a band called the Singles with Este Haim from HAIM, Holly Miranda, Kendra Morris, and Julia Haltigan. The group's first single was called \"Candy\". Johansson was issued a cease and desist order from the lead singer of the Los Angeles-based rock band the Singles, demanding she stop using their name. In 2016, she performed \"Trust in Me\" for ''The Jungle Book'' soundtrack and \"Set It All Free\" and \"I Don't Wanna\" for ''Sing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''. In 2018, Johansson collaborated with Pete Yorn again for an EP titled ''Apart'', released June 1.",
    "Personal life": "=== Relationships and marriages === \nthumb|left|upright=0.75|Johansson and [[Colin Jost at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival]]\n\nWhile attending the Professional Children's School, Johansson dated classmate Jack Antonoff from 2001 to 2002. She dated her ''Black Dahlia'' co-star Josh Hartnett for about two years until the end of 2006. According to Hartnett, they broke up because their busy schedules kept them apart. Johansson began dating Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds in April 2007. They became engaged in May 2008 and married in September 2008 in a wilderness retreat on Vancouver Island. They separated in December 2010 and divorced in July 2011. In a 2019 interview with ''Vanity Fair'', Johansson reflected on the marriage. \"I mean, the first time I got married I was 23 years old. I didn't really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticized it, I think, in a way.\"\n\nIn November 2012, Johansson began dating Frenchman Romain Dauriac, the owner of an advertising agency. They became engaged the following September. The pair divided their time between New York City and Paris. She gave birth to their daughter, Rose, in 2014. Johansson and Dauriac married that October in Philipsburg, Montana. They separated in mid-2016. In March 2017, Johansson filed for divorce, saying their marriage was \"irretrievably broken,\" despite Dauriac urging her to withdraw the action. She never did, and the divorce was finalized in September 2017.\n\nJohansson began dating ''Saturday Night Live'' co-head writer and ''Weekend Update'' co-host Colin Jost in May 2017. In May 2019, the two were engaged. They married in October 2020 at their New York home. She gave birth to their son in August 2021. Johansson resides in New York and Los Angeles.\n\n=== In the media === \nIn September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were leaked online. She said the pictures had been sent to her husband, Ryan Reynolds, three years prior to the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher JC Lattès over libelous statements about her relationships in the novel ''The First Thing We Look At'' by Grégoire Delacourt. She was awarded $3,400; she had sued for $68,000.\n\nJohansson has criticized the media for promoting an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women. In an essay she wrote for ''The Huffington Post'', she encouraged people to maintain a healthy body. She posed nude for the March 2006 cover of ''Vanity Fair'' alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. The photograph sparked controversy as some believed it demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men."
